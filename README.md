### 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a data-driven problem solver with experience across business analytics, machine learning, NLP, and cloud engineering.  
Before pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at UT Austin, I spent 3+ years in analytics and cloud automation roles, working on data pipelines, EDI integrations, and stakeholder-facing BI solutions.

I enjoy building clean, interpretable ML models, transforming unstructured data into insights, and designing end-to-end analytics workflows.
